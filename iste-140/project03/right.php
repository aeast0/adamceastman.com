                    <p>On the other side of the sword comes an assortment of ethical and moral standpoints that certainly have reason to exist and are still found in a grey area of validity and power. One of the big problems with the creation of music through artificial intelligence pertains to the establishments of copyright and ownership. It brings the question to the table of “Who holds the rights to the resulting composition?”. These sorts of moral dilemmas are beyond the current stage of court and government now so it's impossible to tell. While copyright laws are intended protect and encompass the intellectual property of human creators, the line becomes blurred when it comes to AI.</p>

                    <p>With AI music generators gaining more and more popularity with time, there could be time where demand for human created music becomes obsolete. This could lead to utter economic failure with producers, artists, and others losing their jobs as a result of the music industry migrating into a more AI focused generation. Lastly, it could be argued that AI generated music lacks human touch or soul. Soul plays a massive role in the music. Not just the expression of thoughts, feelings, or expressions, but the connection to nature and oneself is unique experience that can only be retold by a human. While AI may mimic emotional cues, it lacks the ability to capture the depth of the human experience which leaves its composition feeling machine-like and shallow.</p>
