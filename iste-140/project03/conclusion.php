                        The creation of music through the use of artificial intelligence without a doubt has its positive attributes and negative attributes. However, the world is moving into modern time of musical innovation, so AI has the ability to be a very useful collaborator along with human artists. Nothing can replicate the essence of human touch and soul in a musical piece so in that sense it is necessary for humans to still be a part of the music creative process. While laws and regulations need time to catch up to the age of AI-generated music, it is still crucial to preserve the balance between creative potential and authenticity. Ultimately, the future of AI in the world of music composition lies in the hands of humans and what they choose to do with it.
