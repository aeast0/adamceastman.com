                    <p>Serving as a different version of inspiration, artificial intelligence can also be a helpful collaborator when aiding with musical creation. Musicians can input their ideas and drafts into an AI leading to more put together seamless blend between human and machine. A professor at the Universidad Loyola Andalucía in Spain, Miguel Civit, concurs saying: “Moreover, AI music generators can be valuable tools for musicians who lack formal training in music theory, as they can assist in creating complex musical compositions"</p>

                    <p>In today's music industry, time is money and with the AI's ability to craft otherwise time-consuming feats of composition, artists can speed up the process to produce pieces much quicker. This eventually leads to benefitted business side of things providing listeners with more music to enjoy and more plays for the artist. During live performances, artist occasionally compose or create on the spot which is an incredibly difficult and high stakes effort. If AI systems were utilized, they could not only adapt to assist the musician's play style, but also cover any mistakes to make the live experience run smoothly and ensure the listeners are having a good time. </p>
