                            harbors, New York City consists of
                            <strong>five boroughs</strong>, each of which is a
                            county of New York State. The five boroughs—<em

                            consolidated into a single city in 1898. With a
                            census-estimated 2012 population of 8,336,697
                            distributed over a land area of just 302.64 square
                            miles, New York is the most densely populated major
                            city in the United States. As many as 800 languages
                            are spoken in New York, making it the most
                            linguistically diverse city in the world. The New

                        <p>
                            New York traces its roots to its 1624 founding as a
                            trading post by colonists of the Dutch Republic and
                            was named <em>New Amsterdam</em> in 1626. The city
                            and its surroundings came under English control in
                            1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II
                            of England granted the lands to his brother, the
                            Duke of York. New York served as the capital of the
                            United States from 1785 until 1790. It has been the
                            country's largest city since 1790. The Statue of
                            Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came
                            to America by ship in the late 19th and early 20th
                            centuries and is a globally recognized symbol of the
                            United States and its democracy.

                        <strong>Manhattan</strong> is one of the five boroughs
                        of New York City, geographically the smallest but also
                        the most densely populated in the city. Located
                        primarily on the island of Manhattan at the mouth of the
                        Hudson River, the borough is conterminous with New York
                        County, an original county of the U.S. state of New
                        York. The borough and county consist of Manhattan Island
                        and several small adjacent islands: Roosevelt Island,
                        Randall's Island, Wards Island, Governors Island,
                        Liberty Island, part of Ellis Island, Mill Rock, and U
                        Thant Island; as well as Marble Hill, a small area on
                        the mainland bordering the Bronx. The City of New York
                        originated at the southern tip of Manhattan and expanded
                        northward.

                        New York County is the most densely populated county in
                        the United States and is one of the most densely

                        1,585,873 living in a land area of 22.96 square miles,
                        or 69,464 residents per square mile, more dense than any
                        individual American city. It is also one of the
                        wealthiest counties in the United States, with a 2005
                        per capita income above $100,000. Manhattan is the
                        third-largest of New York's five boroughs in population,
                        after Brooklyn and Queens, and it is the smallest

                        <strong>Brooklyn</strong> is the most populous of New
                        York City's five boroughs, with about 2.5 million
                        people, and the second-largest in area. Since 1896,
                        Brooklyn has had the same boundaries as Kings County,
                        which is now the most populous county in New York and
                        the second-most densely populated county in the United
                        States, after New York County (Manhattan). It is also
                        the westernmost county on Long Island. Today, if it were
                        an independent city, Brooklyn would rank as the fourth
                        most populous city in the U.S., behind only the other
                        boroughs of New York City combined, Los Angeles, and
                        Chicago.

                        Brooklyn was an independent city until January 1, 1898
                        when, according to the Charter of “Greater New York,”
                        Brooklyn was consolidated with the other boroughs to
                        form the modern “City of New York.” It continues to
                        maintain a distinct culture. Many Brooklyn neighborhoods
                        are ethnic enclaves where particular ethnic groups and
                        cultures predominate. Brooklyn's official motto is
                        Eendraght Maeckt Maght. Written in early modern Dutch,
                        it is translated, “In unity, there is strength.” The
                        motto is displayed on the borough seal and flag, which
                        also feature a young robed woman bearing fasces, a
                        traditional emblem of Republicanism. Brooklyn's official
                        colors are blue and gold.

                        been coterminous with Queens County since 1899. The

                        five boroughs of New York City. Coextensive with Bronx
                        County, it was the last of the 62 counties of New York
                        State to be incorporated. Located north of Manhattan and
                        Queens, and south of Westchester County, the Bronx is
                        the only borough that is located primarily on the
                        mainland (a very small portion of Manhattan, the Marble
                        Hill neighborhood, is physically located on the
                        mainland, because of the rerouting of the Harlem River
                        in 1897). The Bronx's population is 1,385,108 according
                        to the 2010 United States Census. The borough has a land
                        area of 42 square miles, making it the fourth-largest in
                        land area of the five boroughs, the fourth most
                        populated, and the third-highest in population density.

                        The Bronx is divided by the Bronx River into a hillier
                        section in the west, closer to Manhattan, and the
                        flatter eastern section, closer to Long Island.
                        Technically, the West Bronx is divided from the East
                        Bronx by Jerome Avenue—the continuation of Manhattan's
                        Fifth Avenue—making the West Bronx roughly one-eighth
                        the size of the East Bronx. The West Bronx was annexed
                        to New York City (then largely confined to Manhattan) in
                        1874, and the areas east of the Bronx River were annexed
                        in 1895. The Bronx first assumed a distinct legal
                        identity when it became a borough of Greater New York in
                        1898. Bronx County, with the same boundaries as the
                        borough, was separated from New York County (afterwards
                        coextensive with the Borough of Manhattan) as of January
                        1, 1914.

                    <h3>Geography</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Staten Island</strong> is one of the five
                        boroughs of New York City, in the U.S. state of New
                        York, located in the southwest part of the city. Staten
                        Island is separated from New Jersey by the Arthur Kill
                        and the Kill Van Kull, and from the rest of New York by
                        New York Bay. With a population of 468,730, Staten
                        Island is the least populated of the boroughs but is the
                        third-largest in area at 59 sq mi. The borough is
                        coextensive with Richmond County, and until 1975 the
                        borough was officially named the Borough of Richmond.

                        The North Shore—especially the neighborhoods of St.
                        George, Tompkinsville, Clifton, and Stapleton—is the
                        most urban part of the island; it contains the
                        officially designated St. George Historic District and
                        the St. Paul's Avenue-Stapleton Heights Historic
                        District, which feature large Victorian houses. The East
                        Shore is home to the 2.5-mile F.D.R. Boardwalk, the
                        fourth-longest in the world. The South Shore developed
                        rapidly beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, and is mostly
                        suburban in character. The West Shore is the least
                        populated and most industrial part of the island.
